### Rescue Educational Sanctuary Q
Rescue a dog's life and it'll rescue yours.

#### What is RESQ?
RESQ will be a blockchain-backed rescue facility dedicated to educating people about rescue dogs while doing so in a relaxing and reassuring atmosphere. 

#### What Blockchain?
A multi-blockchain solution seems best for the various aspects of developing RESQ. As such, RESQ will definitely...
- use the STEEM blockchain to blog updates and announcements.
- use ETH to create a smart contract for the RESQ DAO (see below) for funding the development of the RESQ token and onsite kennel related projects... token holders vote on projects
- use ShapeShift to accept a variety of altcoin donations.
- post on STEEM any facility plans and roadmaps, self-sufficiency POAs (rescue homesteading, etc.) and PSA about dogs.
- use DTUBE to publish "dog handling" and other educational videos onto STEEM.

#### Where is this happening?
Since the RESQ Dev Team is currently working with rescue dogs in Spain, the property search is limited to Spanish coastal and southern areas. Once we find a suitable location to purchase and transform into RESQ Kennels, we'll start laying out the plans for converting the property into a self-sufficient retreat. 

#### RESQ DAO Projects: Now & Later
The initial set of RESQ projects will be created by the Founders. Once the groundwork has been laid and the requirements of opening a kennel have been met, then the RESQ DAO will be opened to token holder project suggestions. At which point, the RESQ DAO project funding will become completely voter controlled.  

In the near future, the Spanish property options will be added to a website where RESQ DAO supporters will be able to vote and fund their preferred projects. We have to build the site and the DAO first :D
