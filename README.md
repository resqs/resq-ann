### Rescue Educational Sanctuary Quarantine
Rescue an animal's ~~a dog's~~ life and it'll rescue yours.

#### What is RESQ?
RESQ is a prototype facility that rescues market foods, plastics, and wood wastes from going to landfills AND then RESQ uses the rescued materials to provide for undernourished and undersheltered animals in the local area. ~~RESQ will be a blockchain-backed rescue facility dedicated to educating people about rescue dogs while doing so in a relaxing and reassuring atmosphere.~~

RESQ has created an Ethereum ERC-20 token [RESQ Contract Address](https://etherscan.io/token/0x82b5590ecc9231b3a3f518b907557b5961f14242). Currently, the Pir8 Eye Dev Team is acting as custodian. This is not ideal as it keeps the RESQ token centralized. Pir8 Eye is working with Solidity to develop a decentralized smart contract solution. If you have experience working with DAOs and with creating Voting contracts in Solidity, please open a Pull Request and let us know how you can help. We're fond of OpenZeppelin, but we're open to suggestions. 

We pay in RESQ tokens and appreciation. Or, if you prefer, we also pay in animal love and a cleaner planet.

#### What Blockchain?
A multi-blockchain solution seems best for the various aspects of developing RESQ. As such, RESQ will...
- use STEEM? to blog updates and announcements (Coming Soon)
- use ETH to create a smart contract for the RESQ DAO (see below) for funding the development of the RESQ token and onsite kennel related projects... token holders vote on projects ([RESQ token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x82b5590ecc9231b3a3f518b907557b5961f14242) = done; RESQ-DAO token = in progress)
- use ShapeShift/Uniswap to exchange a variety of altcoin donations for RESQ tokens?
- post on STEEM? any facility plans and roadmaps, self-sufficiency POAs (rescue homesteading, etc.) and PSA about dogs
- use DTUBE? to publish "dog handling" and other educational videos onto STEEM?.

#### Where is this happening?
Since the RESQ Dev Team is currently working with rescue dogs in Spain, the property search is limited to Spanish coastal and southern areas. Once we find a suitable location to purchase and transform into RESQ Kennels, we'll start laying out the plans for converting the property into a self-sufficient retreat. 

#### RESQ DAO Projects: Now & Later
The initial set of RESQ projects will be created by the Founders. Once the groundwork has been laid and the requirements of opening a kennel have been met, then the RESQ DAO will be opened to token holder project suggestions. At which point, the RESQ DAO project funding will become completely voter controlled.  

In the near future, the Spanish property options will be added to a website where RESQ DAO supporters will be able to vote and fund their preferred projects. We have to build ~~the site and~~ the DAO first :D The SITE is built!!! [RESQ-DAO](https://www.resq.pir8aye.net)

### RESQ-DAO Partners with All For Climate for Fiscal Transparency
See the [full announcement](https://opencollective.com/resq-dao/updates/all-for-climate-and-resq-dao-working-together-for-a-sustainable-future), All For Climate is our Fiscal Host. They're working with climate justice groups like #FridaysForFuture #ParentsForFuture and #ExtinctionRebellion. Over the next few weeks, we'll be transfering all of RESQ's budget onto OpenCollective.
